# ========================
# Loading a Master List file:
# ========================
In the current version, attendance master list should have the following metadata
to ensure correct loading and retrieval of data (list) from the .txt file.
The following essential tags are necessary in order for the app to read the .txt file correctly:

The necessary HEADER TAGS of the masterlist file (.txt):
[section:]
[subject:]
[schedule:]
[type:]

the above tag are the exact symbols being read by the software to load contents of a masterlist file.

Example tag:
[section:2-Loyalty]
[subject:Comp 214 - Basic Programming in C]
[schedule:Monday & Tuesday (5:00 - 7:30pm)]
[type:masterlist]

-- followed by the list of students names---

Note: The above tag must be present inside the .txt file in order for the app to read correctly the file contents.
